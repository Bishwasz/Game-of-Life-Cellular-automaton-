Game of life Made in pygame.
Cellular automaton.
Plane filled with grid where a few simple rule exists.
The rules are:
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Complexity can arise quickly with some patterns, while other result to nothing.
Shows how complexity can arise from simple laws.
